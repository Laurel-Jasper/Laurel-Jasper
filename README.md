Heyo! My name is Jasper or Xeno, I'm a retired pro-gamer and ran my own business for more then 11 years! 

Sadly I had to stop both of those and now I am focusing on a new passion, programming and software engineering!

I'm currently learning C++, javascript, and react!

I would love to collaberate on as many projects as possible! If you are interested in a complete scrub jumping in and "helping out" let me know!

you can reach me through multiple means:
